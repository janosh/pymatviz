    multiple (passed as dict) sets of uncertainty estimates for a single pair of ground
    truth targets `y_true` and model predictions `y_pred`.

    Overconfidence relative to a Gaussian distribution is visualized as shaded
    areas below the parity line, underconfidence (oversized uncertainties) as
    shaded areas above the parity line.

    The measure of calibration is how well the uncertainty percentiles conform
    to those of a normal distribution.
