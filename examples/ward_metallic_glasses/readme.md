# Ward Metallic Glasses Dataset

Ward et al. (2018) - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2018.08.002

This dataset is constructed as the combination of the Landolt dataset, as well as data from 41 other papers, the largest sub data sets came from the following sources:

- M.K. Tripathi, P.P. Chattopadhyay, S. Ganguly, Multivariate analysis and classification of bulk metallic glasses using principal component analysis, Comput. Materials Sci. 107 (2015) 79-87. # codespell:ignore doi:10.1016/j.commatsci.2015.05.010

- Z. Long, H. Wei, Y. Ding, P. Zhang, G. Xie, A. Inoue, A new criterion for predicting the glass-forming ability of bulk metallic glasses, J. Alloys Compd. 475 (2009) 207-219. doi:10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.07.087.

NOTE: We assume that compositions in this dataset are in wt% and not molar percentages. This is because they often sum up to 100. However, there are a significant number of compositions where this does not apply. Unclear whether this is due to errors in the data preparation (e.g. bad OCR of tables) or whether these are actually other types of compositions (e.g. simulation box).
